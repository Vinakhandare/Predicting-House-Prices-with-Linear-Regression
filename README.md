# Predicting-House-Prices-with-Linear-Regression
Key Concepts and Challenges

Data Collection – Acquire a dataset with numerical features and a target variable (house prices).

Data Exploration & Cleaning – Analyze the dataset structure, handle missing values, and ensure data quality.

Feature Selection – Identify the most relevant features contributing to house price prediction.

Model Training – Implement linear regression using Scikit-Learn and train the model on historical data.

Model Evaluation – Assess the model’s performance using evaluation metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).

Visualization – Create visualizations to analyze the relationship between actual and predicted values.

* Learning Objectives

✔ Gain a deep understanding of linear regression concepts.

✔ Develop practical experience in building and optimizing a predictive model.

✔ Learn to evaluate and interpret model performance using key metrics.

This project provides a solid foundation in machine learning and predictive analytics, helping to improve both technical and analytical skills.
